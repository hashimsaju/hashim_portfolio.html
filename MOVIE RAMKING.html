<h1>BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO ME IN MALAYALAM</h1>
<h2>MY TOP 3 MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>BAHUBALI</h3>
<P> Can't imagine I'm the only one who found my way to this two-part Indian epic after salivating over "RRR."

    "Bahubali" doesn't meet "RRR" standards, but few things would. Made a few years earlier, this film looks much cheaper -- some of the CGI is so bad that the movie almost looks like a video game cut scene at times. And the actors just don't hold the screen the way the two leads in "RRR" did. It started to really lose me toward the end, during a loooong battle scene that feels interminable and made my eyes start to glaze over. If I'd known going in that what starts as a flashback wouldn't so much be a flashback as the actual real story of the movie, I would have been prepared. But as it is, the transition into a whole different story at the mid-way point really threw me and killed what momentum the film had been building.
    
    Not completely satisfying as a stand-alone experience, but it does improve a bit when taken with the second part.</P>
<h3>INDIAN</h3>
<P>I highly recommend to watch this movie for two type of audiences- first, those who expect a good thriller from Indian cinema (of course not only Bollywood) and second, those who have only heard Kamal Hassan's name but never watched his any single movie yet. Kamal parts here dual role, one as an old man (Senapathy) who stops the corrupted people, and the other as his son (Chandru) who works in transport department concerning licenses. Kamal did brilliant job in this movie by offering both the roles of a father and a son. Perhaps, if examined clearly this is his career reflecting movie. There are some high definition visual scenes where we can see the real freedom fighters like Subash Chandra Bose and Senapathy together. This is a remarkable work from director Shankar, or say in Indian cinema. His directorial works are highly appreciable. For action lovers also this movie is a good reference.

    In romantic words, this is a love-triangle movie due to the presence of Manisha Koirala and Urmila Matondkar, both who love the same Chandru. They did their own works, and run the movie. But again, this movie falls under three categories- thriller, political (mixed with social) and patriotic as the title itself denotes. I watched countless times, but never felt bored as it is highly entertaining for the three hours continuously. It has two versions, original one in Tamil and another in dubbed Hindi version. In Hindi version there is a slight uneasiness with the uttering words of the actors in their lips as those do not match exactly, since it is a dubbed version.

<h3>KANNUR SQUAD</h3>
<P>I will leave the technical side for the professionals and talk about my personal view on the movie. The satisfaction we were left with after watching this movie was nothing short of pure bliss. Honestly I just love it when a movie comes out with minimal promotion or hype, and performs well solely based on how good it is.

    It's rare nowadays to be able to sit through a movie and finish it without discontent about one thing or another, but this movie did just that and so much more. Every single second of it was executed exceptionally. The direction and cinematography was so good, everyone that was cast did their job perfectly, especially Azeez and Rony, and not to mention The tech guy and the North Indian constable, and I don't have to say anything much about Mammootty right? He did what he always does, he took on the role with class, dissected it, fleshed it out, and made it his own.
    
    Coming to the OST, Sushin Shyam was mixing fire throughout the movie until the very end, the guy never misses. Absolutely loved the movie and worth every single penny. A must watch in the theatres.</P>
